# Introduction

Have you ever wondered how much money you would spend if you didn't start smoking last year? Have you imagined how relieved you would be if you managed to confess to your crush? Sometimes we want to know the effect of our decision, but unfortunately we can't observe the alternate universe - condition when we don't take such decision. Thus, how can we know whether we take a good decision or not?

On this post, we will discuss time series hypothesis testing. Wait, what? Let me give a little explanation..
- Time series: set of data which are obtained in sequential order, e.g. daily household spending, search queries.
- Hypothesis test: examination whether the observed data support our initial guess, e.g. team A plays better than team B

In brief, time series hypothesis testing talks about how we identify whether different time periods have significantly different observation. What's the difference with conducting t-test or ANOVA? Well, we indeed compare difference between two or more groups; but the challenge is that each observation on time series data has serial dependency to other observations and also contains seasonality (e.g. more transactions occur on weekends), so we can't simply separate the observation into some groups. 

To gain more understanding, we'll use ... dataset and jump into practice!
